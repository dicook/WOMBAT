<h1>Visualising big time series data </h1>

<h2>Earo Wang </h2>

<p>We propose an approach to visualisation of very large collections of time series using some dimension reduction techniques. First, we compute a vector of statistical metrics describing a range of characteristics of each time series, and then use Principal Component Analysis to further reduce the data to two dimensions. The biplot, based on the first two principal components, provides a useful exploratory tool, and allows the identification of anomalous time series. We order the time series according to their data density and data depth in the space of the first two principal components. The method enables the most unusual series, based on their feature vectors, to be identified.</p>
