<h1> raptR: Rapid and Pretty Things in R </h1>

<h2> Eugene Dubossarsky, Presciient </h2>

<p> raptR (Rapid and Pretty Things in R) is a new R package for data exploration and visualisation, combining Rstudio's shiny web GUI interface and Hadley Wickham's ggplot2.
raptR provides an easy, intuitive "point and click" interface for a wide range of ggplot2 features. In addition, raptR provides visual data aggregation capability, generalising the visual data analysis conducted with pivot tables.

This presentation will be an overview of raptR's key visualisation and analysis features, along with a discussion of upcoming features, including code generation and visual data preparation using dplyr and reshape.
