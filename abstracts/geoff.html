<h1> Scaling log-linear analysis to datasets with thousands of variables</h1>

<h2> Geoff Webb, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University </h2>

<p>
Association discovery is a fundamental data mining task. The primary statistical approach to association discovery between variables is log-linear analysis. Classical approaches to log-linear analysis do not scale beyond about ten variables. By melding the state-of-the-art in statistics, graphical modeling, and data mining research, we have developed efficient and effective algorithms for log-linear analysis, performing in seconds log-linear analysis of datasets with thousands of variables and providing a powerful statistically-sound method for creating compact models of complex high-dimensional multivariate distributions.
