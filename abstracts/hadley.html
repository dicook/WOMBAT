<h1>EDA = visualise + manipulate + model </h1>

<h2> Hadley Wickham </h2>

<p> Visualisation alone is not enough to solve most data analysis
challenges. The data may be too big or too messy to show in a single
plot. In this talk, I'll outline my current thinking about how the
synthesis of visualisation, modelling, and data manipulation allows
you to effectively explore and understand large and complex datasets.

This work is embedded in R so I'll not only talk about the ideas, but
show concrete code for working with large sets of model. You'll see
how you can combine the dplyr and purrr packages to fit many models,
then use tidyr and broom to convert to tidy datas which can be
visualised with ggplot2.
