This talk is nothing to do with maths, statistcs or algorithms - it's to do with the 90% of your time you will spend getting your data 'algorithm ready'. Phil will talk about the mistakes made and lessons learned in over 25 years as an analytics consultant dealing with data from many diverse industries. The talk will touch on how to receive, sanity check and pre-process data (and more importantly, what not to do) and give many real world examples of what surprises you will often uncover in real data.
