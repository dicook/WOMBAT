<h1>Image-based measurement </h1>

<h2>Richard Beare </h2>

<p>Many experiments capture raw data in the form of images, and the range and availability of instruments producing image data - from basic digital cameras to 3D time series from microscopes and MRI - is ever increasing. However many types of image data must be processed to extract features and measures use in subsequent statistical analysis. Interpreted environments, like R, are very useful in testing approaches when prototyping new applications, but R has been lacking extensive image analysis capabilites. In this talk I provide a brief overview to imaging and introduce the SimpleITK package for R, which provides an extensive range of imaging facilities from the ITK library.</p>
